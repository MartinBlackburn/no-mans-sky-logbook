        "On my walk back to the ship I came across a strange stone, engravged with symbols.",
        "When I touched it, my mind was filled with words and phrases, which eventually dissapeared leaving me with only one word 'please'. It seemed to have transfered a bit of a new language to my mind somehow.",
        "Further interaction with the stone was useless, guess I have learnt all it can from it."
