        "I recived a signal to a manufacturing plant, the door was locked and no one was answering. I looked through the windows but couldn't see anyone.",
        "Worried for anyone trapped inside I decided to blow the doors open.",
        "As soon as the first shot hit the door, those flying robots attacked me. Dealing wth one was easy enough, but they quickly swarmed me. I had no option but to retreat to a cave for saftey.",
        "One inside I soon lost them. I carried on shooting the door from here, eventually it gave way.",
        "There was no one in the plant. Using the console I learnt how to make the alloy 'crolium'."
