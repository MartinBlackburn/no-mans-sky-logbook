        "The gold I found sold for a very nice amount. The station is run by more of the robot people, who I have learned are a race known as the 'Korvax'.",
        "I am going to stay a while here and work on the station to earn a little extra money, hopefully I'll be able to get a new ship from one of the travellers.",
        "While here I'm also going to learn as much of the language as I can, the local Korvaxian? Korvaxite? Korvax, is willing to teach me in trade for carbon."
