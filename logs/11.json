        "Upon leaving the building, I spotted a strange black column. Hoping it was another one of those knowledge stones I headed over to it.",
        "Strange how these columns are naturally occouring, its dark colour seperated by blue veins.",
        "My multi-tool broke it down into an element I hadn't seen before, think I'll call it 'Heridium'.",
        "I have taken as much as I could, hopefully it'll aid me in future repairs or as trade to the robot people."
