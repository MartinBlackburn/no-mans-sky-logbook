        "I have discovered another outpost. Again this one was empty, apart from a few small cargo containers with some Plutonium in.",
        "The console had a few useful blueprints in for my multi-tool and I learnt a bit more of that language from an encyclopedia.",
        "There were also some coordinates for a space station, as I'm running low on cargo space from all that gold, maybe it'll be worth a visit.",
        "First though, I think a good nights rest is in order. Staying here, in the outpost, will be more comfortable than the ship."
