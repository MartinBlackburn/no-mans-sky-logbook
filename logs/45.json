        "I picked up a distress signal from one of the Korvax people. I quickly jumped into my ship and flew to where it was coming form, to find the crash site.",
        "Climbing up the side of the ship to the cockpit, I knew there was no way anyone could survive.",
        "Inside a Korvax alive, only just, both he and I knew he was dying and there was nothing that could be done.",
        "I sat with him and made him as comfortable as possible for his last momenets, which wern't very long. Watching his visor lights fade was possible one of the saddest things I've ever witnessed.",
        "I couldn't bring myself to take his ship. I'm going to take a walk to gather my senses then leave this planet."
