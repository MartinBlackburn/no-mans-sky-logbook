        "I've fallen into a cave, took a bit of a beating from the landing and ruptured my exosuit on some Plutonium crystals.",
        "For now I've patched it up with some tape, I'll have to fix it properly when I get back to the ship.",
        "But while I'm down here I have gethered some extra Plutonium for the ship.",
        "A little further into the cave I saw a green glow, once I got closer it looked like the Plutonium crystals, only green. When the multi-tool broke it down, it reported it as a new element."
