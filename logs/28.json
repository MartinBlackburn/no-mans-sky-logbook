        "I can't beleive my luck, I just found a rocket ship, I've wanted one of these for as long as I can remember.",
        "Quickly I do the math on if I'm able to repair it with what I have on hand, as there doesn't look to be many materials on this planet to help.",
        "Jackpot, I am! Quickly I remove everything from my old ship, and disassemble everything for parts.",
        "Not long into my repairs I realise I have made the biggest mistake of my life, I dont have enough parts to fix the thrusters. I was too excited and miscalculated what I needed.",
        "My mind starts to race. I am going to be stuck here, forever?",
        "With my old ship in parts and the new one mostly repaired, I have no choice but to try find what I need to fix one of them."
