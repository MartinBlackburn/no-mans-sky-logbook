        "Exiting the cave I found a crash ship. I could faintly here one of the Korvax inside, I don't know enough of the language to know what he's fully saying, but I knew enough to know he needs help.",
        "Prying open the cockpit open, his face lit up knowing that he's safe.",
        "Using some iron I gathered from the cave, I patch up his suit and we boost the signal on his distress beacon. It wasn't long before a ship comes to pick him up.",
        "As thanks he gave me his multi-tool, I tried to turn it down, but he insisted I take it. I'm glad he did, because this thing is amazing."
