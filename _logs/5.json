        "To my suprise, there is life on this planet. Inside the build was a strange being, It was covered in technology I've never seen. So much so I'm not sure if it was even biological.",
        "I couldn't work out a word of what it was saying, and due to its visor I couldn't even make out any sort of emotion. It seemed peaceful enough and didn't look to be carrying any sort of weapon. It seemed to want something from me, pointing outside the only thing I could think of was to harvest some carbon for it.",
        "When I returned with the carbon it's visor lit up green, I assume it was happy. In return it taught me a few words of it's language as well as how to upgrade my multi-tool to keep it from overheating.",
        "Using the console in the building I noted some coordinates, not sure what they will lead me to though, maybe other shelters."
